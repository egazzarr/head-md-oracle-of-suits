# DOUGLAS P5 workshop

Today, I am re-learning p5.js. 
It is a library that makes creative coding easy. 
I learn that: creative coders are not only the real, badass coders that write the library, but anyone who fucks around with the libraary. 
In a way, all coding is creative as it generates something from nothing, or from something. 
Anyway, I should read DESIGN BY NUMBERS by John Maeda. 
I also learn that pythin environments translate to vscode profiles, and that I should start being tidier when managing the coding extensions of various coding projects. 
How much I do not miss environments crashes, version updating, error debugging.
Meh
