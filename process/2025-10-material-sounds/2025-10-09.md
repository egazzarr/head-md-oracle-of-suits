# GROUP CREATION : Gold, Zhanlan, Elena 

## Material Sounds 

### We are going to keep working in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/TEAM-X-TEAM-287992e01f9d8080bb41dd3271889edf). 

Use the specific Material-suits to trigger the music.


THOUGHTS:

- only one item per symbol , x4
- hand size
- magnet to keep interaction going in visitor
- concept: make your own card symphony
- spades : metal object
- diamond : stone/precious stone object
- clubs: wood
- heart: fluffy carpet

INSTALLATION:

- Magnet plate in front of visitor
- 4 different materials attached with cable probably to conduct electricity, and magnets underneath . visitors can place one of the four (or all of them) on top of the magnet. this triggers a music sound, different for each of them.
- Another digital screen in front/ on the side will read the position of the objects on the magnetic board and display them. the movement along the y axis will trigger the metamorphosis of symbols throughout history, educating about the symbols origins.
- Considering about screen size to inform the historical fact in the museum.
- What kind of visual we want to show on the screen?
- How does the music change? which sounds exactly?
